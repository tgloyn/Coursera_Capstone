The problem I would like to define is someone seeking out an apartment around the Toronto area, but has specific preferences as to which/
amenities are located close by. They would rank these preferences in terms of importance out of 10, and then a recomendation system would generate/ 
a top few ideal locations for that individual using Foursquare's venue location data about the various neighborhoods in the surrounding area. It would/
apartment seekers to get efficient, customizable recommendations that adhere to their venue preferences.
